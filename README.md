# go-tinyraytrace
I saw [tinyraytrace](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer) and thought, "wow
that is pretty cool and doesn't look too bad" so I decided to follow the
amazing wiki attached to the same repo and try my hand at implimenting it in
golang. I chose golang because it is a language I am trying to get better at
and this project was the perfect oppertunity for me to learn better golang.
